					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p class="sample-text">
                    As robot technology proliferates in manufacturing, on the road, and other
                    settings that humans currently occupy, it is becoming increasingly important to
                    make robots capable of safely and efficiently performing their assigned tasks
                    without interfering with humans. To do so, a robot can have a model for the
                    human’s behavior, use that model to predict the human’s actions, and then plan
                    its own actions accordingly to prevent interfering or colliding with the human.
                    However, the robot’s human model will always have error because humans act in
                    complex and often unpredictable ways. Instead of blindly trusting the human
                    model, it would be better for the robot to adjust its confidence in the model
                    in real time by using inference based on the human’s actual behavior. This way,
                    the robot could adjust its behavior based on how confident it is in its human
                    prediction.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    This method of reasoning about the robot’s confidence in its human model was
                    developed in the paper “Probabilistically Safe Robot Planning with
                    Confidence-Based Human Predictions,” from Professor Anca Dragan’s and Professor
                    Claire Tomlin’s research groups at UC Berkeley. Our goal for this project was
                    to implement this technique for turtlebots. Given an environment with a
                    turtlebot and a human, where each agent has its own goal state, the turtlebot
                    should be able to safely reach its destination while probabilistically avoiding
                    collision with the human by updating its confidence in its human model based on
                    the human’s true trajectory. To have a reasonable scope for this project, we
                    decided to focus on the perception through planning stages. In other words, we
                    aim to detect the human’s and turtlebot’s positions, predict the human’s future
                    path, and have the turtlebot create safe plans as the human navigates the
                    environment.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    To achieve this goal, we needed to address several challenges. How do we
                    accurately and reliably detect the human’s and turtlebot’s current positions?
                    How is the human model used to predict the human’s future path? How can the
                    turtlebot plan a safe path to its goal using the human’s predicted trajectory?
                    How does the turtlebot apply controls to follow this path? How do these
                    subtasks work together in real time? Our approaches to answering questions are
                    detailed in the sections below.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    Implementing a system that allows the robot to quantify and act on its
                    uncertainty about the human model is useful in any situation in which humans
                    and robots are operating in the same physical space. For example, these
                    situations arise in manufacturing settings where robots and humans cooperate to
                    assemble things, and when autonomous vehicles must plan trajectories based on
                    their predictions of human-driven cars’ trajectories.

					<p class="sample-text">
                    To succeed, our system had to fulfill certain requirements. It must accurately
                    and robustly detect the positions of the turtlebot and human, even in the
                    presence of other objects in the scene. The robot must assume some model of the
                    human and use this model to predict the human’s future trajectory in the form
                    of probability occupancy grids over the state space. The robot must update its
                    confidence in this human model using Bayesian updates and the human’s true
                    trajectory. The robot must create plans to reach its goal from the current
                    state while avoiding collisions with the human with some probability threshold.
                    The robot must apply controls to reliable stick to its planned trajectory.
                    Moreover, all of these subtasks need to be fulfilled in real time in order for
                    the turtlebot to be able to quickly re-predict the human’s behavior, replan,
                    and follow the most recent plan using the human’s most recent state.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    To achieve this functionality, we used four modules for our system: perception,
                    human prediction, planning, and control.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    <b>Perception:</b>   Given a global view of the entire
                    environment using a camera, we utilize computer vision/deep
                    learning techniques to detect the human’s position. We also
                    use the turtlebot’s odometry to keep track of its current
                    state.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    <b>Human prediction:</b>   Given the human’s current and goal
                    positions, we use a linear human model, which assumes the
                    human will walk in a straight line from its current
                    position to the goal, to predict the human’s future
                    trajectory in the form of probability occupancy grids. We
                    adjust our confidence in this human model using Bayesian
                    updates over the human “rationality” parameter, utilizing
                    the human’s true detected trajectory.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    <b>Planning:</b>   Given the turtlebot’s current and goal
                    positions, as well as the predicted human occupancy grids,
                    we create a plan for the turtlebot that avoids colliding
                    with the human with some fixed probability threshold.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    <b>Control:</b>   Given the turtlebot’s most recent plan, we
                    use the turtlebot’s current position to apply controls to
                    match this plan as reliably as possible.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    We used a modular design such that each of these modules received specified
                    inputs from the other modules and return specified outputs. This allowed us to
                    develop and test these modules independently.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
                    When designing this system, we had to consider the limitations of available
                    hardware, which proved to be significant given the real-time requirements of
                    our system. Our perception system reliably detected the human’s position up to
                    industry standard, but its speed was severely limited by the amount of
                    computational power we had available, resulting in delays that affected the
                    other modules. For planning, we needed to use an algorithm that would use the
                    predicted human occupancy grids to quickly find a viable path and immediately
                    replan based on new state information. For the control module, we required a
                    way for the turtlebot to smoothly and closely follow a discretized trajectory,
                    as well as switch to following a new plan upon receiving it from the planning
                    module.

                                    decided to work mostly in simulation we stopped

                                    position from the perception service (or from a
                                    simulated human, which we used for most of the

                            In addition to the main launch file we also used
                            another launch file to control the camera and
                            perception module. We faced long startup times for

                                <p class="sample-text">
                                We added on to the code from the AR Tracking
                                lab (lab 4) and created a grid in the “working
                                area” of our floor space. We then used this
                                code and the grid to compute a homography
                                between the camera coordinates and the floor
                                coordinates by manually specifying point
                                correspondences. We saved this homography in a
                                constants file and recomputed it whenever we
                                felt that the coordinates were not accurate.
                                The camera service is also adapted from lab 4
                                and provides a service that returns the last
                                frame from the camera’s video stream
                                </p>
                            <h3>Human Detection</h3>
                                <p class="sample-text">
                                The human detection node node gets the last
                                image from the service, uses a pre-trained
                                MobileNet model to output the bounding boxes
                                and probabilities for all classes, and then
                                publishes the coordinates of the “highest
                                rated” or most confident bounding box for a
                                human in the scene. The original code simply
                                ran inference on a stream from a webcam so we
                                had to adapt it for ROS, ignore everything
                                except humans, find the highest rated one and

                                <p class="sample-text">
                                For the human prediction module we mostly used
                                the code provided from the paper in [1]. It
                                takes in the positions of the human and returns
                                a series of occupancy grids representing the
                                predicted heatmap of locations of the human for
                                each time step in the future (up until some
                                configurable end time step)
                                </p>
                            <h3>A-Star Search-based Planning</h3>
                                <p class="sample-text">
                                In the paper [1] the robots used FaSTrack for
                                planning, which took in the time-varying
                                sequence of occupancy grids that was returned
                                by the human prediction module and used them to
                                compute robust plans. We thought it would be
                                easier to implement a custom planner using A*
                                search over the time varying sequence of
                                occupancy grids so we wrote a custom A* search
                                node for this module. The basic idea is that we
                                turned the occupancy grids into a 3D matrix of
                                shape (length) * (width) * (number of
                                timesteps) and then performed a search over
                                this space, using as a heuristic the manhattan
                                distance between the current position and the
                                goal state. In addition, when exploring the
                                “neighbors” of a particular space we enforced
                                two constraints: firstly that the space was
                                “forward” in time to ensure that the plan was
                                actually achievable in the real world where
                                time only flows forward, and secondly that the
                                neighboring space was unoccupied. To test if
                                the space was occupied we used a Monte Carlo
                                simulation (essentially throwing darts based on
                                the occupancy probabilities) and checked how
                                many of them landed within a configurable
                                turtlebot radius. If this value was above a
                                threshold we counted the space as a collision
                                and did not allow the A* search to include the
                                space in its plan. This module publishes the
                                plan as a series of waypoints - one for each
                                time step - in a message type we made called a
                                plan (described below)

                                <p class="sample-text">
                                For actually controlling the turtlebot we used
                                an approach similar to lab 6 where we measure
                                the error between the current state (from the
                                turtlebot’s odometry) and the goal state (from
                                the plan) and provide a control input that
                                moves the turtlebot closer to the goal state.
                                In order to follow the plans as they were
                                provided we set the first waypoint of the most
                                recent plan as the current goal and replaced it
                                with the next waypoint when the robot moved to
                                be within a threshold of the current goal. When
                                a new plan was published we replaced any
                                waypoints with the waypoints from the new plan
                                to ensure that the robot always acted on the
                                most recent information. As we switched the
                                goal of the project to be focused on getting
                                everything working in simulation this module
                                was reasonably buggy and did not always provide
                                the correct control inputs to the turtlebot.

					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We tested the perception, human prediction, and planning
                    modules independently, and each of these subsystems worked
                    well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Perception</h3>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We were able to reliably draw a bounding
                    box around the human and translate that to a position on
                    the floor grid using our computed homography between the
                    camera and floor coordinates. We also successfully used the
                    turtlebot’s odometry to track its position and orientation.

                    <h3>Human Prediction</h3>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We used the code released from the
                    original paper to set custom human and goal states and
                    predict human occupancy grids multiple timesteps into the
                    future.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Path Planning</h3>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We used A* search to quickly create a plan for
                    the turtlebot that probabilistically avoids collision with
                    the human.

                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We used a PD controller to compute controls
                    that would follow the turtlebot’s current plan and
                    transmitted these controls to the turtlebot.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Integration</h3>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    We experienced difficulties when connecting all of these
                    systems due to the limited amount of computational power we
                    had available, which resulted in time delays that
                    complicated the real time nature of our system. We
                    connected the human perception, turtlebot odometry, human
                    prediction, and planning modules together, making it
                    possible to detect the human position, plan the human’s
                    predicted trajectory, and generate a plan for the
                    turtlebot. However, this system ran very slowly,
                    particularly due to the complexity of the computer vision
                    human perception system. Therefore, we decided to focus on
                    the human prediction and planning modules.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                    The video below shows our simulated system in RViz. The
                    tall red rectangular prism is the human, the red dots are
                    the human’s goals, the grids around the human extending
                    upwards are the predicted human probability occupancy
                    grids, and the green dots are waypoints along the
                    turtlebots plans. As the human moves, the occupancy grids
                    predict the human walking in a straight line toward one of
                    its goals. Unfortunately, due to the time delays in the
                    system, the turtlebot is unable to plan around the human in
                    real time. However, you can see the plans avoiding the
                    human delayed by a few seconds. This suggests that if we
                    had access to more powerful computational hardware, we
                    would have been able to successfully connect all of our
                    modules into a complete real-time system.

								<p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.</p>

									“Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking”
